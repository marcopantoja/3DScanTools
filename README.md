# 3DScanTools
Repository to hold various tools and python scripts for manipulating scan data based on different calibrations, creating new calibrations from different sets of calibration target captures, generating fused scans from aligned multiview scan data, measuring scans to compare 3d captured data to real world measurements from CMM, and summarizing data from the generated xml files containing measurements, metadata, and calibration parameters. 

Note, some files are not provided for actually running the python scripts like dependency .exe programs for making calibrations, reprojecting scan data using new calibrations, or comparing calibrations for differences in reprojection errors from simulated points.
